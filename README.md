This project is to make a portfolio of previous and ongoing porojects. This porject collects them all into one website that allows me to add new porjects or delete outdated ones. 
To run this project locally, first download all the necessarry files, next run the program on your personal computer, enter the url that is given or use it as a hyper link. You can then view the website.
I learned how to incorperate things like sql alchemy and flask to create a website about the previous things ive learned and made.
